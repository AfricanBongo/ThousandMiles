# 1000 Miles (Mock project)
### :soccer: Goal
The goal of the project was to incentivize citizens for using their personal vehicles less and walking more so as to reduce total fuel import cost for the government.
This would also improve the fitness standard of the general populace and could alternatively be used by medical aid providers to provide benefits for customers who have
higher fitness levels as those people are less prone to succumbing to ailments.

### What I did (as a UX Engineer :iphone:)
- Designed the user interface and communicated changes and decisions to the rest of the team.
- Translated the user interface designs into the frontend code, i.e. I coded the entire user interface using Jetpack Compose (Android UI framework).
- Connected the frontend to a Firebase backend for authentication and storing user data, and Health Connect to gather steps data.
